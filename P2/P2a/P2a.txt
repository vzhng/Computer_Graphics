P2A: Object/Character Modeling

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Decide on an object that you want to include in your final animation. 
The key aspect of this assignment is that the 3D object that you create should be made up of multiple pieces. 
You will use the matrix stack and the transformations (rotate, scale, translate) to put together the parts to form the final object.

REQUIRED ELEMENTS FOR CHARACTER:
1. Your object should be something recognizable, and not some abstract or random shape.
2. Use at least twelve different sub-parts to make your object (e.g. six spheres and six cylinders).
3. Include at least two different kinds of parts in your object (e.g. sphere and block).
4. Most or all of the sub-parts of your object should be touching or overlapping each other.
5. Use at least two different colors in your object.
6. You must use pushes and pops, and they should be balanced (same number of each).
7. Make use of all three basic transformations to assemble your object (rotate, scale, translate).

Slowly rotate your object to show it from different sides.
When your Processing code is run, it should display your object, and slowly rotate it to show what the object looks like from different 
sides. This rotation of the whole object does not count towards your use of rotate to assemble the object.
